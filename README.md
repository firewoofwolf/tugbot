--ABOUT--

Tugbot is an old discord bot idea I had back in 2021, but I only now had the skills to make it.
estimated code time it took to code is around 2 weeks

--INFO--

The bot doesn't use / commands, it uses chat responses for a sort of nitrotype feeling, also
because I don't know how to code / commands, or anything beyond chat responses.
